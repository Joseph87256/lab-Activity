<h1>NAME:Owusu-Achiaw Joseph<br>PROGRAMME:Computer Engineering<br>YEAR:1<br>SIR,</h1>

<P>|<i> MT LAB</i></P>

<P>I am<strong><i> Owusu-Achiaw Joseph.</i></strong></P>.    I was born in Akwatia,a charming town in the<strong> Eastern Region of Ghana</strong>.<br>
It is mainly known to people as the<em> land of diamonds </em> it is mined over there.
Growing up in a family of six was always lively and full of energy and dreams.
<br> My parents,<strong>Mr. & Mrs. Owusu-Achiaw</strong>, instilled in me the spirit of hardwork,respect,obedience,and compassion.<br>
I have six siblings including myself. They have always been my partner in crime throughout the years.
This draws my attention to the times we use to steal meat from soup... hahaha!!!...Im kinda ambivert,how awkward.<br><br>
Some of my fondest childhood memories include playing soccer which I stopped because of academic activities,etc..
My community was  close-knit,and I cherished the times spent with my extended family and friends. 
Keta Senior High Shool is my alma-mater,where I developed an insatiable taste for IT but I did biology though instead of IT.
The world has changed rapidly in the process of growing up. Apparently,  we are in the world of  Information and technology, 
and I decided to move along with the world.<br><br>
I am a computer engineering student in the prestigious instituition of <strong> Nkrumah University of Science and Technology,"nyansapo,w)sane no badwenba"</strong>
Computer Engineering is a fascinating field that combines electrical engineering and computer science to design,develop and test computer hardware and software<br><br><br>

 <strong>WE ARE PROBLEM SOLVING MACHINE,CURIOUS ABOUT HOW THINGS WORK AND INNOVATIVE</strong>.<br><br>
 <strong> THANK YOU</strong>.
